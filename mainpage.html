        <!--About me paragraph-->
        <p>
            I am a recent graduate from the University of Central Arakansas (December 2024).
            I have two bachelor's degrees in computer science and cybersecurity.
            I enjoy coding and I am looking to become a software engineer at the entry level.
            I have had one internship as a network security intern at Oaklawn Jockey Club where I helped to maintain and keep our system's firmware up to date, analyzed threats to our system, set up new machines and configured them to the proper network configuration settings, and even helped to set up a way to automatize and filter our firewall logs.

    <!--Oaklawn Internship-->
    <h3>Network Technician Intern</h3>

    <!--Oaklawn Internship paragraph-->
    <p>Over the Summer of 2024, I interned at Oaklawn in my hometown of Hot Springs, AR. I had a wonderful time there and I grew to know my coworkers quite well. I had several roles and responsibilities throughout my time there, including but not limited to: setting up new workstations for employees, updating and distributing firmware, general helpdesk support for all kinds of machines, updating and maintaining network configurations for machines and which vLAN they should go to, and I even got to help the software engineer that we had develop some in house programs for minor applications, like an employee scan in program.</p>

    <!--Tour Guide header-->
    <h3>Tour Guide</h3>

    <!--Tour Guide paragraph-->
    <p>You're probably wondering "why did he add a position like tour guide when he wants to be a software engineer?" I believe that this position helped me tremendously in all of my future endeavors as I had to communicate and keep people engaged every day, and condense large and complex pieces of information to be more understandable on an every day basis. I believe these skills could be greatly beneficial to any company and would set me apart from my peers when placed in a workplace environment.</p>
