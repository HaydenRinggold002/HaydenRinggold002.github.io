    <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Central Arakansas (December 2024). 
    I have two bachelor's of science degrees in computer science and cybersecurity. 
    I enjoy coding and I am looking to become a software engineer at the entry level. 
    I have had one internship as a network security intern at Oaklawn Jockey Club where I helped to maintain and keep our system's firmware up to date, analyzed threats to our system, set up new machines and configured them to the proper network configuration settings, and even helped to set up a way to automatize and filter our firewall logs.</p>
